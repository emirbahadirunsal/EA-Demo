"""
Hardware communication module for the Haptic System.

This module uses the pyvisa library to communicate with an external signal
generator or similar hardware device over a standard VISA interface. 
It handles the connection lifecycle, manages the device state to prevent 
redundant commands over the serial/USB connection, and safely limits output voltages.
