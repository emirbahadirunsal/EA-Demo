"""
Main entry point for the Haptic System application.

This script initializes the Pygame environment, sets up the main display window,
and manages the primary application loop. It handles switching between different 
haptic feedback modes (Heart, Texture, and Train), captures user input (mouse/finger position), 
calculates the corresponding haptic signals, and communicates these signals to the hardware 
via the HapticController.
