"""
Train Acceleration Simulation Mode for the Haptic System.

This module simulates the sensation of a train slowly starting and then 
accelerating up to a high speed. It features a 3D perspective visual of 
train tracks and uses an exponential curve to increase both the visual 
speed of the passing railway sleepers and the haptic frequency.
